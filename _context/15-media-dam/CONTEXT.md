# Stage 15 — Media (Digital Asset Manager)

> Owns the operator media library at `/operator/media` — R2-backed asset storage, AI tagging + heuristic quality scoring, organization (folders / selects / tags), the two external share surfaces (sponsor delivery + member gallery), and the reusable `<DamPicker>`.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **State** | 🟡 In progress — Phases 1/2a/2b merged & live in prod (#26/#27/#29); HEIC ingest built + locally validated (full chain on a real HEIF), PR #30 merging to prod; Phase 3 (Timeline) spec'd & deferred (awaiting real event photography) |
| **V1 item** | Post-V1 (new capability, not in items #1–#28) |
| **Last updated** | 2026-05-27 |
| **Owner** | Adam |
| **Blocked on** | Nothing for Phase 1. AI tagging no-ops until `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN` are set in Vercel (upload/thumb/BlurHash/EXIF/heuristic scoring all work without them). |
| **Next** | Confirm #30 production deploy READY, then Adam validates a real iPhone .HEIC on prod (old photo → EXIF shootDate ≠ upload time); Vercel-revert the deployment if it fails. Then start the Phase 4 share-surfaces spec (sponsor `/assets/[token]` + member `/gallery/[slug]` + ShareLink creation + download logging). |

> **Media-page polish (2026-05-27, separate PR):** title top-padding, filter-rail date-input overflow, Trash/help-FAB clearance, view-density active state, "New folder" button, and a visible preview close (×). Operator-grid UX only — no HEIC/Phase-4 changes.

## Scope

The operator-facing Digital Asset Manager and its external share surfaces. Delivered in 6 phased PRs (build order = dependency order):

1. ✅ **Foundation** — Prisma schema, R2 private storage, image processing (800px thumbnail / BlurHash / EXIF `shootDate`), async AI tagging + Sharp heuristic scoring, upload API.
2. ✅ **Operator grid** at `/operator/media` — **2a** (justified grid, BlurHash, signed-URL thumbs, sort/filter/FTS, folder tree, density, nav) + **2b** (selection + bulk bar [flag/ZIP/tag/move/delete], FLIP transitions, full-screen preview + inline edit, world-class upload [drag-drop files/folders + click-to-browse + clipboard paste, live per-file XHR progress with thumbnails], trash restore/purge, Top Picks, manual reorder).
3. 🟡 **Timeline / Moment Map** view (single-event, `shootDate`-plotted) — **spec'd & deferred** (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-27-dam-phase-3-timeline-design.md`); build awaits real event photography. (HEIC ingest prerequisite lands first — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-27-dam-heic-ingest-design.md`.)
4. ⚪ **Share modes** (`/assets/[token]` sponsor, `/gallery/[slug]` member) + white-label branding + link analytics/notifications.
5. ⚪ **MCP tools** at `/api/mcp` (9 tools).
6. ⚪ **`<DamPicker>`** modal + event-editor hero integration.

Full design contract: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-dam-design.md`.

## Inputs

- Operator photo uploads (multipart `file`), optional `folderId` / `eventId` / `sponsorName` / `shooterCredit` form fields.
- Env: `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` / `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `R2_EVENT_MEDIA_BUCKET` (reused), `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN`, `IMAGE_TAGGING_PROVIDER` (default `cloudflare`), `CLOUDFLARE_AI_IMAGE_MODEL` (optional, default `@cf/microsoft/resnet-50`), `DAM_TAG_SECRET` (optional internal-trigger guard).
- Operator identity + workspace via `requireRole(STAFF)` (`lib/operator-role.ts`).

## Outputs

- Workspace-scoped `Asset` rows; R2 objects at `dam/{workspaceId}/{assetId}/original.*` + `thumb.webp` (private).
- Incremented `Workspace.storageBytes` on upload.
- Async writes: `Asset.aiTags`, `Asset.qualityScore`, `Asset.qualityScores`, `Asset.energyLevel`.
- Short-lived signed GET URLs minted server-side at render time (consumed by Phases 2/4 UI).

## Rules — DO NOT VIOLATE

1. **Assets are PRIVATE in R2.** Never expose raw/public R2 URLs. Serve only via short-lived signed URLs (15-min display / 24-hr download) minted server-side. (Producer/CLAUDE.md scoping rules also apply — this is the stage-specific addition.)
2. **AI tagging/scoring never blocks the upload response and never throws into the upload path.** `tagImage()` returns `[]` and logs on any failure or missing config.
3. **R2 only.** No Vercel Blob, no Cloudinary in this stage. The legacy event-hero Vercel Blob route (`app/api/media/upload`) is out of scope and must not be repurposed for the DAM.
4. **Tagging/scoring uses Cloudflare Workers AI + Sharp only — not an Anthropic call.** The CLAUDE.md model lock does not apply here and must not be circumvented by routing image tagging through Anthropic.
5. **Phase-1 quality scoring is heuristic only** (Sharp: Laplacian-variance sharpness + histogram exposure). No vision-model/LLaVA scoring and no face detection until a later phase explicitly adds it.
6. **`Asset.eventId` / `MediaFolder.eventId` are plain strings (no FK).** Do not add a relation that edits the Producer-shared `Event` model.

## What this stage does NOT own

- **Event hero image** storage/display (legacy Vercel Blob) — Stage 03. DamPicker (Phase 6) only *writes* the chosen asset identifier into the existing `Event.heroImageAssetId` string; it does not change that field or the hero pipeline.
- **MCP transport/auth** (`lib/mcp/`, `/api/mcp`) — Stage 08. This stage adds DAM *tools* there in Phase 5.
- **Operator role/auth model** (`lib/operator-role.ts`) — root. This stage consumes `requireRole`.
- **Workspace branding fields / settings UI** — Stage 07. Phase 4 adds the `/operator/settings/branding` panel and reads branding for share pages.

## Schema fields

- `Asset` — id, workspaceId, filename, url (R2 key), thumbnailUrl (R2 key), blurhash, fileType (PHOTO/VIDEO), size (Int bytes), width, height, duration, shootDate, tags[] (manual), aiTags[] (AI), qualityScore, qualityScores (Json), energyLevel, shooterCredit, isSelect, sortOrder, folderId, eventId, sponsorName, uploadedBy, deletedAt (soft delete), createdAt, updatedAt.
- `MediaFolder` — id, workspaceId, name, type (FULL_GALLERY/SELECTS/VIDEO/SPONSOR/BRAND), eventId, parentId (self-tree), usageRightsExpiry, sortOrder, deletedAt, createdAt.
- `ShareLink` — id, workspaceId, token (unique), folderId, mode (SPONSOR/MEMBER_GALLERY), password (bcrypt), expiresAt, firstAccessedAt, lastAccessedAt, accessCount, brandingOverride (Json), customDomain (unique), createdAt.
- `AssetDownload` — id, workspaceId, assetId, shareLinkId, downloadedAt.
- `Workspace.storageBytes` — BigInt, total stored bytes (+upload / −permanent delete).

## Routes

- `POST /api/media/dam/upload` — STAFF-gated upload. ✅ Phase 1.
- `POST /api/media/dam/tag/[assetId]` — internal async tag + score. ✅ Phase 1.
- `/operator/media` — operator grid. ⚪ Phase 2.
- `/assets/[token]` (sponsor) + `/gallery/[slug]` (member). ⚪ Phase 4.

## Edge cases

- **Fire-and-forget tagging is best-effort on Vercel** — the post-response trigger fetch is not guaranteed to fire after the serverless function freezes. Acceptable for Phase 1 (tagging is non-critical and no-ops until `CLOUDFLARE_*` is set). Production hardening (`waitUntil` / queue) is a tracked follow-up.
- **Video** is enum-supported (`AssetFileType.VIDEO`) but the Phase-1 upload pipeline accepts images only (Sharp processes images); video ingest is a later phase.
- **HEIC/HEIF** is now accepted on upload and converted to a q90 JPEG (stored full-res) before Sharp processing — prebuilt Sharp/libvips can't decode HEIC on Vercel, so `lib/dam/heic.ts` decodes via libheif (`heic-convert`). EXIF `shootDate` is read from the original HEIC (the converted JPEG loses it); the original HEIC is discarded after conversion. The client `accept` filter in `UploadDropzone` still lists only `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp`, so the Browse picker greys out HEIC — drag-and-drop is the working path until that filter is widened (tracked follow-up).
